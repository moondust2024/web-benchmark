CPU Performance Test
Welcome to the CPU Performance Test repository, an JavaScript-based solution designed to assess the computational capabilities of your browser's environment. This tool runs directly in your web browser, eliminating the need for any installations or additional software, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

Features
Cross-platform Compatibility: Works seamlessly across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on various operating systems.
Open Source: The codebase is open for contributions, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation to new technologies.

How It Works
The CPU Performance Test executes a series of JavaScript operations that stress the CPU, measuring the time taken to complete these tasks. These operations include complex mathematical calculations, array manipulations, and other intensive processes. The results are then displayed in an easy-to-read format, providing insights into the performance characteristics of the user's hardware.
